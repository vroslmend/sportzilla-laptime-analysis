**Sportzilla LapTime Analysis** is a data-analysis project designed to help visualize and gain insights from racing lap-time data on tracks we have visited.  
By loading race data (e.g. lap times per driver, split times, etc.) and running our Jupyter notebooks, you can quickly generate statistics, charts, and summaries that help you understand performance, consistency, and trends over time.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **{trackname}_scrapper.csv** — Website data scrapper for lap times of each driver from RaceFacer
- **data_{trackname}.csv** — CSV file with best lap-time per driver
- **lap-analysis-{trackname}.ipynb** — Notebook for race-level summaries (fastest lap, average lap time, consistency metrics, driver comparisons)  
- **lap-analysis-{trackname}.html** — Race-analysis notebook for convenient sharing/viewing

## ✅ Features
- Clean and preprocess raw lap-time data.  
- Visualize lap-time trends and distributions using charts (histograms, line plots, scatter plots).  
- Compare performance among drivers or races.
